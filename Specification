Prepared by: Assistant
1. Introduction
This module specifies the requirements for the Homepage and Account Creation Functionality of the Wedding Speech Writing Assistant. The homepage serves as the primary entry point for users, designed to be engaging and mobile-friendly, with a focus on encouraging sign-ups. The account creation process is simple, requiring minimal user input, and includes a login mechanism for returning users. This module is self-contained, with clearly defined interfaces to ensure it can be swapped or modified independently while integrating with other modules of the application.
2. Scope
This specification covers:
•	The homepage layout, including its visual components (hero section, benefits, testimonials, footer, and login button).
•	The account creation process (sign-up with first name, email and password).
•	The login functionality for returning users (login with email and password)
•	All outputs and interfaces to support modularity and integration.
Only the requirements explicitly stated by the user are included, with no assumptions about other modules (e.g., speech generation or editing).
3. Functional Requirements
3.1 Homepage
The homepage is the main landing page for users, optimized for mobile devices while remaining functional on desktops. It follows a specific structure with interactive elements to drive user engagement and account creation.
3.1.1 Structure and Components
The homepage is composed of the following sections, presented in order:
1.	Header/Hero Section: 
o	Description: A full-screen section at the top of the page to capture user attention.

	Dynamic Background Image: A full-screen image that rotates or subtly animates (e.g., a slideshow of wedding-speech related) to create an engaging first impression. The image must scale appropriately for mobile and desktop displays.
o	Text: 
	Title: A bold, prominent headline (e.g., "Craft Your Perfect Wedding Speech"). Font size and weight should emphasize importance, optimized for readability on small screens.
	Subtitle: A normal-font, concise description below the title (e.g., "Create heartfelt speeches with ease in minutes"). Smaller font size but clear and legible.
o	Action: 
	Start Now Button: A clickable button below the subtitle, styled to stand out (e.g., bright color, rounded edges). Clicking this button directs users to the account creation form (see Section 3.2).
2.	Benefits Section: 
o	Description: A section highlighting the unique selling propositions (USPs) of the service to convince users of its value.
o	Content: 
	Three short blocks of text, each describing a benefit or USP (e.g., "Easy to use," "Personalized speeches," "Perfect for any role").
	Each block should be concise (1-2 sentences) and visually distinct (e.g., displayed in a grid or card layout on desktop, stacked vertically on mobile).
o	Action: 
	Start Now Button: A second clickable button below the benefits section, identical in style to the hero section’s button, linking to the account creation form.
3.	Testimonials Section: 
o	Description: A section to build trust by showcasing feedback from previous users.

Module 2: Personal space for users and info collection through writing assistant

Functional Specification for Wedding Speech Writing Assistant
Module 2: Personal Space and Writing Assistant (Info Collection)
Version: 1.2
Date: April 13, 2025
Prepared by: Assistant
1. Introduction
This module specifies the requirements for the Personal Space and Writing Assistant (Info Collection) for registered users of the Wedding Speech Writing Assistant. The personal space serves as a private, user-specific area where users interact with a chat-based writing assistant to provide essential information and content for crafting their wedding speech. The assistant collects key details (e.g., user’s role, wedding date, style preferences) and real user stories/anecdotes, preparing the user to move to content creation (a separate module). This module is self-contained, with clearly defined interfaces to ensure modularity and ease of future changes.
2. Scope
This specification covers:
•	The personal space interface, including a personalized greeting and display of past communication.
•	The chat-based writing assistant for collecting essential information (user’s role in the wedding, wedding date, speech length recommendations with user confirmation, and style preferences) and user stories/anecdotes for speech content.
•	The transition to the next phase (content creation, Module 3) after collecting all inputs.
•	All inputs, outputs, and interfaces to support modularity and integration.
Only the requirements explicitly stated are included, with no assumptions about other modules beyond the transition to Module 3.
3. Functional Requirements
3.1 Personal Space
The personal space is a private area accessible only to registered users after logging in. It serves as the hub for interacting with the writing assistant and reviewing past interactions.
3.1.1 Interface
•	Greeting: 
o	Displays a personalized message at the top of the personal space: “Hi [First Name]” (e.g., “Hi John”).
o	The first name is retrieved from the user’s account data (provided by Module 1).
•	Past Communication: 
o	Displays all previous communication with the writing assistant, including: 
	All text messages (assistant and user).
	All audio files that are recorded by the user are transcribed while being recorded and shown as such in the frontend (no playback), .
o	Presented in chronological order, identical to the original chat format (same bubble design, see Section 3.2.1).
o	Available immediately upon login, evolving as new interactions occur but always showing the full history looking backward.
•	Design: 
o	A clean, minimal interface optimized for mobile and desktop.
o	The greeting is prominent (e.g., larger font, bold).
o	The chat interface (see Section 3.2) occupies the main area of the screen, with past communication scrollable above the active chat input.
•	Accessibility: 
o	The personal space is accessible only to authenticated users (via login from Module 1).
o	A logout option is available (e.g., a button in the top-right corner) to return to the homepage.
3.1.2 Outputs
•	Rendered Personal Space: 
o	A webpage or app view (e.g., /dashboard) displaying the greeting, past communication (text and audio), and chat interface.
o	Responsive across devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).
3.2 Writing Assistant (Info Collection)
The writing assistant, named Ed Davies, uses a chat-based format to collect essential information and content from the user, preparing them for speech creation. The interaction is conversational, feeling like chatting with a good friend, and supports both text and audio input.
3.2.1 Chat Interface
•	Format: 
o	A chat-like interface where the assistant sends messages/questions, and the user responds.
o	Messages appear sequentially, mimicking a real-time conversation (e.g., assistant’s message appears, user responds, next message follows).
o	User responses can be: 
	Text Input: Typed into a text field.
	Audio Input: Recorded via a microphone button, allowing users to speak their response (e.g., a “Record” button that captures audio and submits it as a file).
o	Audio responses are transcribed (assumed backend capability) for processing and stored as playable files in the chat history.
•	Design: 
o	Assistant Messages: 
	Appear on the left in a bubble style.
	Each bubble includes an image of Ed Davies (e.g., a friendly headshot or avatar) to personalize the interaction, making it feel like chatting with a good friend.
	Text is conversational and warm (e.g., “Hey, I’m excited to help you!”).
o	User Messages: 
	Appear on the right in a contrasting bubble style (no avatar for user).
	Text responses display as typed.
	Audio responses display as a playable audio player (e.g., a waveform with play/pause) with optional transcription below.
o	A text input field and a microphone button are at the bottom for user replies.
o	Mobile-friendly: Messages stack vertically, input field and buttons are touch-friendly.
•	Tone: 
o	Friendly, encouraging, and personal, as if speaking with a close friend (e.g., “Awesome, let’s make this speech amazing!”).
3.2.2 Information and Content Collection Process
The assistant asks a series of questions to gather essential details and content, in the following order:
1.	User’s Role in the Wedding: 
o	Question: A prompt to establish the user’s relationship to the wedding (e.g., “Who are you in the wedding? For example, are you the bride, groom, best man, or someone else?”).
o	User Input: Text (e.g., “I’m the maid of honor”) or audio (e.g., user records “I’m the maid of honor”).
o	Validation: Ensures a non-empty response (text or audio). If unclear, the assistant asks for clarification (e.g., “Thanks! Just to confirm, are you a speaker at the wedding?”).
o	Storage: The role is saved for use in speech customization.
2.	Wedding Date: 
o	Question: A prompt to collect the wedding date (e.g., “When is the wedding?”).
o	User Input: Text (e.g., “June 15, 2025”) or audio (e.g., user says “Next month”).
o	Validation: Parses the input (text or transcribed audio) to extract a date. If ambiguous (e.g., “Soon”), prompts for clarification (e.g., “Could you share the specific date or month?”).
o	Storage: The date is saved (as a string or parsed date object) for context in later modules.
3.	Speech Length Recommendations: 
o	Assistant Action: Based on the user’s role, the assistant provides a recommended speech length and seeks confirmation or alternative preference. 
	Logic: Predefined guidelines, e.g.: 
	Bride/Groom: 3-5 minutes.
	Best Man/Maid of Honor: 4-6 minutes.
	Parent: 2-4 minutes.
	Other roles: 2-5 minutes (default).
	Message: Example: “As the best man, I’d recommend a speech of 4-6 minutes—it’s perfect for sharing stories and keeping everyone engaged. Does that sound good, or do you have something else in mind?”
	User Input: Text or audio response (e.g., “Sounds good” or “I’d prefer 3 minutes”).
	Validation: If the user specifies a different length, that preference is saved; otherwise, the recommendation is used.
o	Storage: The confirmed or user-specified length is saved (e.g., “3 minutes” or “4-6 minutes”) for Module 3.
4.	Style Preferences: 
o	Question: A prompt to gauge the user’s preferred speech style (e.g., “What kind of speech are you imagining? For example, are you outgoing and want something fun, or do you prefer something heartfelt and formal?”).
o	User Input: 
	Text (e.g., “I’m outgoing, so I want it fun!”) or audio (e.g., user says “Something fun”).
	Optionally, predefined options (e.g., buttons for “Fun,” “Heartfelt,” “Formal,” “Mix”) to simplify input, depending on implementation.
o	Validation: Ensures a non-empty response. If vague, prompts for more detail (e.g., “Got it! By fun, do you mean humorous or lighthearted?”).
o	Storage: The style preference is saved (e.g., as a string or category like “fun,” “heartfelt”).
5.	Transition to Content Collection: 
o	Message: After collecting the above information, the assistant prompts to begin gathering content (e.g., “Brilliant! Are we ready to start on the actual content?”).
o	User Input: A simple confirmation via text (e.g., “Yes”), audio (e.g., user says “Yes”), or a button (e.g., “Let’s Go”).
o	Behavior: If the user confirms positively (e.g., “Yes”), the assistant proceeds to the content collection questions (below). If the response is negative or unclear, the assistant prompts again (e.g., “No worries! Let me know when you’re ready.”).
6.	Content Collection (User Stories and Anecdotes): 
o	Assistant Action: The assistant asks a set of conversational questions to collect real user stories and anecdotes, tailored to the user’s role, as if a human writer or close friend were gathering material for the speech. 
	Logic: Questions are role-specific, based on the user’s role from step 1. A specific list of questions is pending, but examples include: 
	For a sibling: “Tell me a story from when you were kids.”
	For bride/groom: “Tell me a fun fact or a good story about when you met or the first dates you went on.”
	For other roles (e.g., best man): Generic prompts like “Share a memorable moment you had with the couple.”
	Number of Questions: At least 2-3 questions to gather sufficient content, asked one at a time with a back-and-forth flow (assistant asks, user responds, assistant acknowledges and asks the next).
	Message Style: Warm and engaging, e.g., “Oh, I bet you’ve got some great memories! Tell me a story from when you were kids,” followed by an acknowledgment like “That’s amazing! How about another moment that stands out?”
o	User Input: Text or audio response, allowing detailed stories (e.g., “We used to build forts in the backyard…” or a recorded anecdote).
o	Validation: Ensures a non-empty response. If vague or too brief, prompts for more detail (e.g., “Love that! Can you tell me a bit more about what happened?”).
o	Storage: Each story/anecdote is saved (as text or transcribed audio) for use in Module 3.
7.	Transition to Module 3: 
o	Final Message: After collecting stories, the assistant concludes with a prompt to transition to the next phase (e.g., “Fantastic, we’ve got some great stories to work with! Ready to move on to crafting the speech?”).
o	User Input: A simple confirmation via text (e.g., “Yes”), audio (e.g., user says “Yes”), or a button (e.g., “Let’s Go”).
o	Behavior: Upon confirmation, the assistant triggers a navigation event to Module 3 (content creation).
3.2.3 Outputs
•	Collected Data: 
o	A structured dataset containing: 
	User’s role (string, e.g., “maid of honor”).
	Wedding date (string or date object, e.g., “2025-06-15”).

o	Handles session authentication to secure the personal space.
•	Module 3 (content creation, not specified): 
o	Must accept the collected speech data (including stories) as input.
o	Accessible via a defined URL or route.
6. Technical Considerations
These notes guide developers without prescribing implementation details.
•	Frontend Framework: 
o	React, Vue.js, or similar for dynamic chat rendering.
o	State management (e.g., Redux, Vuex) to track chat progress and persist communication history across sessions.
•	Chat Interface: 
o	Use WebSocket or polling for real-time feel (optional, depending on backend).
o	Store messages and audio files in local state during the session, synced with backend.
•	Input Parsing: 
o	Basic NLP (e.g., regex or simple libraries like date-fns) for wedding date extraction from text or audio transcriptions.
o	Predefined role categories (e.g., bride, groom, best man) for validation.
o	Flexible parsing for stories to capture narrative content without strict formatting.
•	Audio Handling: 
o	Use browser APIs (e.g., MediaRecorder) for audio capture.
o	Store audio files in a CDN or backend with unique URLs.
o	Integrate a transcription service (e.g., third-party API) for audio responses.
•	Modularity: 
o	Encapsulate the personal space as a component (e.g., PersonalSpace.jsx).
o	Separate the chat logic into a reusable service (e.g., WritingAssistant.js).
o	Use environment variables for API URLs and Ed Davies’ image URL.
7. Error Handling
•	Personal Space: 
o	Missing user data: Redirect to login (Module 1) with error message (“Please log in”).
o	Past communication load failure: Display a fallback message (e.g., “Loading history…”).
o	Page load failure: Display a fallback UI with logout option.
•	Writing Assistant: 
o	Empty response (text or audio): Prompt again (e.g., “Could you share your role?”).
o	Invalid date: Ask for clarification (e.g., “Could you specify the date?”).
o	Vague story: Prompt for more detail (e.g., “That’s a start! Can you tell me more?”).
o	Audio upload failure: Show message (e.g., “Audio didn’t upload. Try again or type instead?”).
o	Server error: Show generic message (e.g., “Oops, something went wrong. Try again?”).
8. Outputs Summary
•	Personal Space: 
o	A responsive webpage (/dashboard) with greeting, past communication (text and audio), and chat interface.
•	Collected Data: 
o	JSON object with role, wedding date, confirmed length, style preference, and stories/anecdotes.
•	Chat Log: 
o	Persistent record of text messages and audio files, displayed upon login.
•	Navigation: 
o	Redirect to Module 3 upon user confirmation after content collection.
9. Assumptions
•	Module 1 provides user data (first name, email) and authenticates access.
•	Module 3 exists to handle content creation and accepts the collected data, including stories.
•	A backend stores user data, chat history (text and audio), and speech data securely.
•	An audio transcription service is available for processing audio inputs.
•	The image of Ed Davies is provided as a static asset (e.g., /assets/ed-davies.jpg).
•	The specific list of content questions will be provided later; placeholders are used for now.
•	The chat is sequential (one question at a time), with no branching beyond clarification prompts.
10. Conclusion
This specification defines Module 2: Personal Space and Writing Assistant (Info Collection), incorporating the requested addition while preserving all other requirements. It includes a personalized greeting, a chat-based assistant (Ed Davies) with a friendly image in bubbles, support for text and audio input, confirmation of speech length preferences, display of all past communication (text and audio) upon login, and a new step to collect role-specific user stories/anecdotes after confirming readiness. All inputs (user data, chat history), outputs (speech data, chat log, navigation), and interfaces (API payloads, redirects) are specified to ensure modularity and compatibility with Cursor. The module is self-contained, ready to integrate with other modules while allowing easy modifications.



























Module 3 Speech Writing
Nice. Now moving on to module three, which is the actual speech generation or the speech writing. The speech writing happens in the same space, same personal space, which is unique to each user. So when module two is complete, the assistant gets anecdotes and all sorts of information from the user and is happy with the collected inputs. The speech generation kicks in with something like, nice work, I'm confident I can do a first draft with the lovely input you provided. Is there anything else you would like to add at this point, or shall I start drafting? And don't worry, we can always edit and add or make adjustments later. So this is really just about getting started with the writing. Have you noticed? So yes, after that confirmation from the user, if the answer is positive from the user, do generate a draft speech which is unique to the user For the style of the speech use to start preference indicated by the user And do make sure language is simple and easy to make it easy for people to give to speech No complicated words, no complicated long sentences, just a very easy and intuitive speech. Good checks are Hemingway. You can use Hemingway app for free to make sure sentences are easy to understand and short. You can use George Orwell's rules for effective writing, which also is an excellent check to make writing better. Feel free to use any other writing support you can find on the internet, support in terms of resources to make a speech, an excellent speech. Also please build on all the great information there is around how to structure how to build a good wedding speech including yes what makes a good joke if a user wants something slightly fun and lighthearted or just really good things that can be built into a speech Try it and test it, but do make the speech tailored to each particular user based on the unique input they provided and just really how they interacted with you as the assistant. Then in terms of showing the draft of the speech, do not display the speech in a way that is fully visible or visible to the user. We want to show to the user that a speech for them was created, but we don't want the speech to be openly available just yet. So maybe an idea is to have you know like adding lines to as the speech is being written in the interface but having them blurred so that the user gets a sense of, yes, the speech is generated for him or her at that point. And it's all coming together. And it's basically there, but they just cannot see it yet. They can only see it after successful payment, which is module 4, which we talk about at the moment. But for now, stick to requirements for module 3, which is speech generation or speech writing. And yes, define clear inputs, clear outputs. So we can make changes to this module easily later on. Also for the requirements, keep them concise. No duplication if not necessary. Take all the words you need to explain in a good way, but cut all fluff. We just need a really good two-to-point specification for Module 3 now. Thank you.

Module 3: Speech Generation
Version: 1.0
Date: April 13, 2025
Prepared by: Assistant
1. Introduction
This module specifies the requirements for the Speech Generation functionality of the Wedding Speech Writing Assistant. It operates within the user’s personal space, using data collected in Module 2 to generate a unique, tailored wedding speech. The assistant initiates the process with a confirmation prompt, creates a draft speech with simple language and user-specific content, and displays it in a blurred format to indicate completion without revealing the text until payment (Module 4). This module is self-contained, with clear interfaces to ensure modularity and ease of future changes.
2. Scope
This specification covers:
•	The speech generation process within the personal space, including a confirmation prompt.
•	Creation of a unique draft speech based on user inputs (role, style preference, stories), using simple language and effective writing principles.
•	Display of the draft in a blurred format to indicate completion without visibility.
•	All inputs, outputs, and interfaces to support modularity and integration.
Only the requirements explicitly stated are included, with no assumptions about other modules beyond inputs from Module 2 and transition to Module 4.
3. Functional Requirements
3.1 Speech Generation Process
The speech generation occurs in the user’s personal space (same interface as Module 2), continuing the chat-based interaction with the assistant, Ed Davies.
3.1.1 Initiation
•	Prompt: 
o	After Module 2 completes (all inputs collected), the assistant sends a message in the chat interface: “Nice work, [First Name]! I’m confident I can do a first draft with the lovely input you provided. Is there anything else you’d like to add at this point, or shall I start drafting? Don’t worry, we can always edit and add or make adjustments later.”
o	Example: “Nice work, John! I’m confident I can do a first draft with the lovely input you provided. Is there anything else you’d like to add at this point, or shall I start drafting? Don’t worry, we can always edit and add or make adjustments later.”
•	User Input: 
o	Text or audio response (consistent with Module 2), e.g., “Go ahead” or “Nothing else, start drafting.”
o	Optionally, a button (e.g., “Start Drafting”) for confirmation.
•	Behavior: 
o	If the response is positive (e.g., “Yes,” “Go ahead,” or button click), the assistant proceeds to generate the speech.
o	If the user provides additional input (e.g., “Add that I met the groom in college”), it’s appended to the stories/anecdotes from Module 2 and saved.
o	If the response is negative or unclear (e.g., “Not yet”), the assistant prompts again: “No problem! Let me know when you’re ready or if there’s more to share.”
3.1.2 Speech Generation
•	Trigger: Positive user confirmation to start drafting.
•	Process: 
o	The assistant generates a unique draft speech based on: 
	Inputs from Module 2: 
	User’s role (e.g., “maid of honor”).
	Wedding date (for context, e.g., “this June”).
	Confirmed speech length (e.g., “3 minutes”).
	Style preference (e.g., “fun,” “heartfelt”).
	Stories/anecdotes (e.g., “We built forts as kids”).
	Any additional input from the initiation prompt.
	Style: 
	Matches the user’s style preference (e.g., fun includes light humor, heartfelt emphasizes emotion).
	If “fun,” incorporates appropriate humor (e.g., a light-hearted anecdote or a tasteful joke, based on best practices for wedding speech humor).
	Language: 
	Simple and clear, avoiding complicated words or long sentences.
	Passes checks inspired by: 
	Hemingway App: Ensures readability (Grade 6 level or lower), short sentences, minimal adverbs, and active voice.
	George Orwell’s Rules for Effective Writing: 
	Avoid overused phrases (e.g., no clichés like “love is a journey”).
	Use short words where possible (e.g., “happy” over “ecstatic”).
	Cut unnecessary words (e.g., “very” or “really”).
	Prefer active voice (e.g., “I saw” over “It was seen by me”).
	Avoid jargon or foreign phrases.
	Natural and conversational, as if spoken by the user.
	Structure: 
	Follows best practices for wedding speeches (researched from web resources): 
	Introduction: Welcomes the audience, introduces the speaker’s role (e.g., “Hi everyone, I’m Jane, the maid of honor”).
	Body: Incorporates user’s stories/anecdotes, tailored to the role and style (e.g., a sibling’s childhood memory or a groom’s first-date story).
	Conclusion: Ends with a toast or well-wishes (e.g., “To Emma and Jack, here’s to a lifetime of love!”).
	Length adheres to the confirmed duration (e.g., 3 minutes ≈ 400-500 words at a natural speaking pace).
	Tailoring: 
	Unique to the user, weaving in their specific anecdotes and details (e.g., names, events).
	Reflects the user’s interaction tone (e.g., if they were chatty, the speech feels warm and personal).
•	Resources: 
o	Leverages web-based best practices for wedding speeches (e.g., structure tips, humor guidelines).
o	Ensures jokes (if fun style) are tasteful, avoiding anything offensive or overly niche.
3.1.3 Draft Display
•	Format: 
o	The draft is not fully visible to the user.
o	Displayed in the personal space’s chat interface as a “preview”: 
	Text appears as blurred lines (e.g., CSS blur filter or a frosted overlay), simulating a speech’s length and structure.
	Lines are added progressively (e.g., over 5-10 seconds) to give a sense of the speech being written in real-time.
	The blurred text indicates the speech is complete but locked until payment (Module 4).
•	Message: 
o	After the blurred draft appears, the assistant adds: “Your speech is ready, [First Name]! It’s all set for you, but we’ll need to unlock it to see the full text. Ready to proceed?”
•	Behavior: 
o	The blurred draft remains visible in the chat history.
o	No user interaction with the draft is allowed (e.g., no clicking to reveal).
o	The assistant awaits navigation to Module 4 (payment).
3.1.4 Outputs
•	Draft Speech: 
o	A text string (e.g., “Hi everyone, I’m Jane… To Emma and Jack!”).
o	Stored securely in the backend, linked to the user’s account.
o	Not accessible to the user until Module 4.
•	Chat Log Update: 
o	Includes the initiation prompt, user response, and blurred draft preview.
•	Navigation Event: 
o	Triggers a redirect to Module 4 (e.g., /payment) after the draft is displayed.
4. Non-Functional Requirements

10. Conclusion
This specification defines Module 3: Speech Generation, exactly as requested. It includes a confirmation prompt, generation of a unique, simple, and tailored speech within the personal space, and a blurred draft display to indicate completion. Inputs (Module 2 data), outputs (speech, chat log, navigation), and interfaces (API payloads, redirects) ensure modularity and compatibility with Cursor. The module is concise, self-contained, and ready to integrate with Module 4.











Module 4 Payment 
Great, now module four. Module four is payment. So once the speech is drafted for a user, and the user gets a feel that it's there, it's a perfect time to ask for payment for the user, basically to unlock the speech and take it from there. So for the payment module, Well, module, serve with something like all done as a confirmation that the speech is created and a nice segue to prompt the user to pay. I'm open to suggestions what the best way is for taking payments. But yes, the user should be able to pay in a very easy way with either a credit card or maybe Apple Pay or Google Pay on their phone. If mobile or desktop, of course, if Ed Davis is accessed on a desktop. But remove all restriction or friction if possible. Make it really easy. Make sure that the user understands it a one payment and it a fixed payment that I will specify Don hard the price but it will be a fixed payment per speech which will always be the same for each user Actually, scrap that. No, it's just a fixed one-off payment per user. I'll define the details on that later. As with the other modules, stick to just that module. It should be modular, so it can be easily changed later on independently of the others. But yes, it kicks in after module three is complete. And next steps will be module five, which will be the refinement of the draft after the payment has gone through. So yes, maybe still part of module four, which we're talking about here is once payment is done and successful, redirect or bring the user back into the interface, the personal space. With the speech, which is the output from module three, draft now visible to the user. Thanks.

Thanks for pointing that out. You're right—my specification for Module 4 included some technical details (like references to PaymentService.js or Stripe Elements) that lean toward implementation rather than pure requirements. For a functional specification meant for Cursor, we should focus solely on what the module needs to do, not how it’s coded. Those details are better left to Cursor or the development phase.
Below is a revised version of the Module 4: Payment specification, stripped of any code-specific or implementation details while keeping all the functional and non-functional requirements exactly as you provided. It remains concise, modular, and focused on what’s needed for Cursor to understand the requirements, with no fluff or duplication. The structure and content align with your original request, just cleaner and purely requirement-focused.

Module 5 Draft Refinement 
Last but not least module 5 which is the draft refinement and iterations on the speech until the user is fully satisfied. So this is an iterative process between the user and the assistant. There's no restriction to how many back and forths there are. We keep going until the user is fully, fully happy with the speech. Make sure to be responsive to the user's inputs and drafts and requests and anything they would like to change. So if the changes relate to the entire speech, do change the entire speech. If it's more about a phrase or a paragraph or a section, only change that while keeping everything else. So be really a good listener to what people have to say and incorporate as much feedback as you possibly can to make a speech really work for them and for them to be comfortable with it Follow the same instructions for language and style and style after speech as in other modules. But if a user decides they want to be, let's say, more or less funny or shorter or longer, like if it's new information that contradicts previous information, go with the user want, be and then. So in those cases, you can discard the previous information and go with how the user feels right then. The user is always right, so be positive, be supportive, try and understand and clarify, if not fully clear what the user wants, but go with their instinct and make them happy with their speech until they're fully, fully happy.


Functional Specification for Wedding Speech Writing Assistant
Module 5: Draft Refinement
Version: 1.3
Date: April 13, 2025
Prepared by: Assistant
1. Introduction
This module specifies the requirements for the Draft Refinement functionality of the Wedding Speech Writing Assistant. It operates within the user’s personal space, enabling an iterative process where the assistant, Ed Davies, refines the unlocked speech (from Module 4) based on user feedback. The process supports unlimited back-and-forth until the user is fully satisfied, responding to any feedback or changes requested via text or audio, prioritizing the user’s latest preferences, even if they contradict earlier inputs. The module is self-contained, with clear interfaces to ensure modularity and ease of future changes without impacting other modules.
2. Scope
This specification covers:
•	An iterative refinement process in the personal space via the chat interface.
•	Unlimited back-and-forth to incorporate user feedback, change requests, or additions, using only text or audio input.
•	Responsiveness to new preferences (e.g., style, length), overriding prior inputs if needed.
•	Adherence to simple language and user-defined style, with supportive clarification.
•	All inputs, outputs, and interfaces for modularity.
Only the stated requirements are included, with no assumptions beyond integration with Modules 1-4.
3. Functional Requirements
3.1 Draft Refinement Process
The refinement process occurs in the user’s personal space, using the same chat interface as Modules 2-4, with the assistant, Ed Davies.
3.1.1 Initiation
•	Trigger: Module 4 completes (unlocked speech displayed).
•	Message: 
o	The assistant sends: “Here’s your speech, [First Name]! Take a look and let me know what you think. Want to change or add anything? I’m here to make it perfect!”
o	Example: “Here’s your speech, John! Take a look and let me know what you think. Want to change or add anything? I’m here to make it perfect!”
•	User Response: 
o	Provided via: 
	Text: Typed input (e.g., “Make it funnier”).
	Audio: Recorded input (e.g., user says “Shorten it”).
o	Feedback can include: 
	Change requests or additions, driven by user intent. Examples: rewriting the whole speech (“Start over”), editing a part (“Fix the ending”), tweaking a word (“Say ‘joyful’ instead”), or adding content (“Include our trip story”).
	New preferences (e.g., “Make it shorter,” “Less funny now”).
	Satisfaction (e.g., “It’s perfect!”).
o	Examples are illustrative, not fixed categories; changes depend entirely on the user’s conversational input.
•	Behavior: 
o	Feedback with changes/additions triggers refinement (see 3.1.2).
o	Unclear feedback prompts clarification: “Thanks, [First Name]! Can you share more about what you’d like?”
o	Satisfaction (e.g., “I’m happy”) ends with: “Awesome, [First Name]! Your speech is all set. Anything else I can help with?”
3.1.2 Speech Refinement
•	Process: 
o	The assistant updates the speech based on user feedback (text or audio), with no limit on iterations.
o	Scope of Changes: 
	Fully flexible, driven by user requests. Examples include rewriting the entire speech, editing specific parts, adjusting words, or adding content, but these are illustrative, not fixed types.
o	Responsiveness: 
	Incorporates feedback as fully as possible, aligning with user intent.
	Prioritizes latest preferences if contradictory (e.g., “Now 2 minutes” overrides “4-6 minutes”; “Less funny” overrides “fun”).
o	Language and Style: 
	Matches Module 3 guidelines: 
	Simple, clear language (Grade 6 readability, short sentences, active voice, minimal adverbs).
	Avoids clichés, uses short words, cuts unnecessary words, prefers active voice, avoids jargon.
	Natural, conversational, tailored to user’s role and stories.
	Uses latest style preference (e.g., “fun,” “heartfelt”) or updates if changed (e.g., “Now formal”).
	Adjusts length if requested (e.g., “Make it 2 minutes”).
o	Supportive Tone: 
	Positive, encouraging (e.g., “Great call, let’s make it shorter!”).
	Clarifies unclear requests: “You want it more heartfelt—any specific vibe in mind?”
•	Iteration: 
o	After updating, the assistant shows the revised speech: “Here’s the updated speech, [First Name]! What do you think? Anything more to change or add?”
o	User responds via text or audio with feedback or approval.
o	Continues until full satisfaction.
3.1.3 Completion
•	Trigger: User confirms full satisfaction (e.g., “It’s perfect”).
•	Message: 
o	The assistant confirms: “Fantastic, [First Name]! Your speech is finalized and ready to shine. Anything else I can do?”
•	Behavior: 
o	Final speech remains visible in the chat interface.
o	No further prompts unless user reinitiates.
3.1.4 Outputs
•	Refined Speech: 
o	Text string of the latest or final speech.
o	Stored securely, linked to user’s account.
•	Chat Log Update: 
o	Includes all back-and-forth: feedback, clarifications, drafts.
•	Final State: 
o	Speech marked “finalized” in backend on satisfaction.
