## Claude API Integration - Technical Details

### Implementation Architecture
The Claude API integration follows a serverless approach to maintain security and scalability:

1. **Serverless Function (`functions/claude-assistant.js`)**
   - Handles all requests to the Claude API
   - Securely manages API key via environment variables
   - Processes user messages and returns AI responses
   - Implements error handling and basic rate limiting

2. **System Prompt Management**
   - Uses a centralized briefing document (`functions/briefing_ai_assistant.md`)
   - Loads the briefing at runtime to allow easy updates
   - Combines briefing with user-specific context

3. **Client-Side Service (`js/services/claude-service.js`)**
   - Provides a clean interface for frontend components
   - Handles request formatting and error handling
   - Manages specific use cases (chat, speech generation, analysis)

### Security Measures
- API keys stored in environment variables (.env locally, Netlify env in production)
- Keys never exposed to client-side code
- Added to .gitignore to prevent accidental commits
- Git history cleaned of any sensitive data
- Rate limiting and token restrictions to prevent abuse

### Error Handling
- Implemented retries for transient network errors
- Specific error responses based on error type
- Client-friendly error messages
- Logging for debugging

### Future Integration Points
1. **User Authentication**
   - Validate JWT tokens from request headers
   - Verify user identity before processing requests

2. **Storage Integration**
   - Save generated speeches to Supabase
   - Retrieve and update drafts

3. **Payment Verification**
   - Check user's payment status
   - Restrict functionality based on subscription level

4. **Conversation Management**
   - Store conversation history
   - Include previous context in AI requests

### Model Configuration
- Using the latest Claude model: claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219
- Configured for wedding speech generation
- Optimized prompts for conversational guidance 

## Stripe Integration - Planned Implementation

### Implementation Architecture
The Stripe integration will follow a serverless approach similar to the Claude API integration:

1. **Serverless Functions**
   - `functions/stripe-checkout.js` - Creates checkout sessions
   - `functions/stripe-webhook.js` - Handles payment confirmations
   - `functions/payment-options.js` - Provides available payment options

2. **Payment Flow**
   - User completes Module 3 (Speech Generation)
   - Payment prompt displayed in chat interface
   - User initiates checkout process
   - Redirect to Stripe Checkout (hosted by Stripe)
   - Return to application after payment
   - Update user status and unlock speech

3. **Client-Side Components**
   - Payment button/UI in dashboard
   - Success/failure handling
   - Unlocked content display

### Database Integration
- Update user payment_status from 'free' to 'paid'
- Record payment details in payment_records table
- Link payments to user accounts

### Security Considerations
- API keys stored in environment variables
- Webhook signature verification
- Secure redirect handling

### Testing Strategy
- Use Stripe test mode and test cards
- Simulate successful and failed payments
- Verify database updates and UI changes 

## Next Priority Action Items

1. **GitHub Configuration**
   - Create staging branch (immediate priority)
   ```bash
   git checkout -b staging
   git push -u origin staging
   ```
   - Set up branch protection rules after team grows

2. **Netlify Configuration**
   - Configure staging environment deployment
   - Set up branch preview deployments

3. **Code Integration**
   - Complete Chat Interface â†” AI Assistant integration
   - Implement conversation history management
